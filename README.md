## Project Overview
BugTrackr is a web-based bug tracking system that centralizes bug reporting, prioritization, and resolution tracking. The platform serves QA teams, developers, product managers, and team leads who need visibility into software defects across projects. The system enforces structured bug submission through mandatory fields, provides real-time dashboard updates, and automates assignment and notification workflows to ensure bugs reach the right people immediately.

## Core Functionality
- **Structured Bug Submission**: Form-based bug creation with required fields (title, description, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, severity, environment, attachments)
- **Intelligent Assignment**: Automatic routing to component owners based on bug category and team structure
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Live-updating bug status board with filtering, sorting, and custom views
- **Priority & SLA Management**: Severity-driven prioritization with automatic SLA escalation for overdue bugs
- **Duplicate Detection**: AI-powered suggestions to identify and merge duplicate reports
- **Status Workflow**: Customizable bug lifecycle (New → Assigned → In Progress → Testing → Resolved → Closed)
- **Search & Filtering**: Full-text search with advanced filters (assignee, severity, status, project, date range)
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Metrics dashboard showing resolution time, team workload, bug trends, and quality insights

## User Journey
1. **Bug Reporter**: Accesses submission form → Fills structured fields → Attaches screenshots/logs → Receives confirmation with tracking ID
2. **Assignment**: System auto-assigns based on component → Assignee receives notification (email + in-app) → Can reassign if needed
3. **Developer**: Views assigned bugs → Updates status as work progresses → Adds comments/notes → Marks for testing
4. **QA Verification**: Reviews fix → Confirms resolution or reopens bug → Closes when verified
5. **Manager/Lead**: Monitors dashboard → Views team metrics → Identifies bottlenecks → Generates reports for stakeholders

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for responsive UI, Redux for state management
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI with RESTful API architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (bugs, users, assignments, history)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (Google/Microsoft) + SAML for enterprise SSO
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for bug attachments (screenshots, logs, videos)
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search and advanced filtering
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and real-time updates
- **Hosting**: Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile**: Responsive design; native mobile apps (iOS/Android) in Phase 2

## API Integrations
- **Slack**: Post bug notifications, create bugs from Slack messages, update status via Slack commands
- **GitHub/GitLab**: Link bugs to commits/PRs, auto-close bugs when related PR merges
- **Jira**: Bi-directional sync for teams using Jira alongside BugTrackr
- **Email**: SMTP for notifications, email-to-bug creation for legacy workflows
- **Webhooks**: Custom webhooks for third-party integrations (CI/CD, monitoring tools)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 for usage tracking; Datadog/New Relic for performance monitoring

## Real-Time Features
- **Live Dashboard Updates**: WebSocket connections push bug status changes to all viewers instantly
- **Instant Notifications**: Real-time alerts for assignment, status changes, comments, and @mentions
- **Collaborative Comments**: Multiple users can comment simultaneously with live updates
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time log of all bug changes visible to team members
- **Presence Indicators**: Show which team members are currently viewing/editing a bug
- **Live Metrics**: Dashboard metrics update in real-time as bugs are created, assigned, and resolved

## Implementation Details
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub/GitLab; feature branches with pull request reviews
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing, linting, and deployment
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests (Jest/Pytest), integration tests, E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright), 80%+ code coverage
- **Deployment**: Staging environment mirrors production; blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- **Database Migrations**: Versioned migrations with rollback capability
- **Logging**: Structured logging (Winston/Pino) with ELK stack or CloudWatch for centralized log aggregation
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for exception monitoring and alerting
- **Documentation**: API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI), user guides, admin documentation, architecture diagrams

## MVP Features
1. Bug submission form with required fields (title, description, steps, severity, environment)
2. Real-time dashboard with bug list, status filtering, and basic search
3. Automatic assignment to component owners (manual configuration by admins)
4. Email notifications for assignment and status changes
5. User authentication (email/password + OAuth)
6. Basic reporting (bug count by severity, resolution time average)
7. Comment/discussion thread on each bug
8. Attachment upload (screenshots, logs)
9. Status workflow (New → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved → Closed)
10. Admin panel for user management, component configuration, and SLA settings

## Future Features
